# CMB2 Meta Split
 *A [Custom Meta Boxes 2](https://github.com/webdevstudios/CMB2) plugin addition that will take care of saving non serialized meta for repeatable fields and groups*

## Caveat
Work in progress, will work for posts only right now.
 
## Installation
Download, copy and paste into WordPress plugin folder and activate; this plugin has no UI.
 
## Usage
The plugin exposes no template tags or functions and will simply save non serialized meta in the database.
